# ML Crash Course Notes

## 1. Introduction
- Topics going to be covered: Supervised, Unsupervised, Recco, Ranking and DL

## 2. Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Naive Bayes
    1. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
    2. Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem.
